        <p>CapitolQuery is a project converting the static, difficult-to-research Congressional Record into a well-organized, easy-to-query database linking floor speeches and committee hearing minutes to data describing Members of Congress and their constituencies.</p>
        <p>With the partnership of UC Berkeley’s D-Lab and the Social Science Research Council, we will be enabling a wave of social science research revealing how Congressional Members’ activities in Congress are shaped, or not, by the districts they represent, their own identities, parties, and more – and the interactions of all these through time. An open resource, researchers and the public will be able to ask and answer new questions revealing gender dynamics in Congress Members’ interactions, shifting legislative priorities, the interplay between electoral and governing incentives, the influence of war on domestic policy, the difference between what political actors say and do… and much more. To learn more, check out this Library of Congress talk describing the work.</p>
